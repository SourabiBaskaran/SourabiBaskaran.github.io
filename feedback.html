                                      <p>Mike Voâ€™s feedback gave me a positive idea about my project idea.Firstly he liked the project team name and he feels the project idea is doable for the further process of the assignments. Secondly he said he likes the way IT can be used for food management. He says this is a positive contribution and can save billions of USD. I also agree to this because food wastage is a big problem and I feel in the upcoming generation it might become a bigger problem. By having a systematic way we could control the wastage of Post harvest. Food management usually happens without most of the people's knowledge. If everyones knew there is excess of production in one area and less in the other area then easily we can avoid this situation and bring a positive contribution and also save money. Thirdly he says that I have identified the challenges and put forth a solution that is by giving the farmers the smart phones so that they can improve their knowledge about food economy and logistics. This is very true as most of the farmers are not aware that there could be an effective solution and they don't need to waste the food.</p>
                                      <p>Mike has mentioned that by just using IT we cannot fully impose the app and successfully run it. There is government and rules that play a major role in decision making. Also as he imports and explores are related with international rules should be kept in mind. And he suggested using social media for reaching many people about this problem. In my project idea i had not taught about this and i feel this feedback has opened my mind about this situation and for future improvement i should consider all these problems and have a solution based on them too. This feedback was very useful to me and this will help my project idea grow one more step ahead. </p>

                                      <p>Linh feels I have written my project idea in detail and meaningfully. I feel yes I have put efforts to even write the details of the project idea to have a better understanding. Then she put up two questions. First one was that she feels bad that food wastage happens due to improper storage after post harvest, lack of access to markets and poor logistics which leads to starvation. She also mentioned why rich countries can exceed what is necessary food to be wasted and why poor countries don't have food. Food grown in rich countries is long lasting and fresh but its really not due to improper storage and poor logatices she feels its due to the last of money. I strongly disagree with this point because I have seen so many rich countries also waste a lot of food as it's in the storage because people are not aware of how much food materials are stocked up in the warehouse. Here the problem is only about food management and not about whether the country is rich or poor. Even in poor countries there is a lot of waste of food because of the poor food management and not because poor countries don't have food. They might have less production of food but most of it is in the warehouse and storage so it doesn't reach the people on time and get spoiled.</p>
                                      <p>Second question was for which counties farmers is this app built for the rich counties or for the poor counties. She also feels if it's for poor county farmers then it's hard for them to use the devices and application. Again i disagree with this point because the father from both the rich or the poor countries mostly everyone will have a smartphone in the 21st century and the basic communication also takes place in smartphones. so for those people it won't be a big problem. But for the people who don't have smartphones we will give them the phones and also help them earn the application because this technology is helping them to avoid wastage and they will also follow it to make the area or their counties succeed in doing a positive contribution and also saving billions of dollars. (write something abt the government like we need to collaborate with the government and they will bring the rule that every farmer has a mobile. </p>
