                                   <p>I am passionate about avoiding food waste and lack of access to technology which leads to poor storage options ( 1/3rd of food produced is wasted per year = US$ 1Trillion. IT innovation that would lead to reducing wastes which are created by human error and lack of information at the right time.</p>

                                   <p>Food Loss and its impact on overall economy and human race. It is of paramount importance for world food program to work on this global issue. While we all are using Information technology for wider variety of problem solving, but food loss, which is one of root cause, is left less attended or ignored.</p>
                                   <p>I intend to contribute to this bigger agenda by building a small IT application, which will use information technological data obtained through careful study of food crops for many generations. I strongly believe that we can arrive at solution to eliminate food waste until it reaches the dining table.</p>

                                   <p>It is despicable thought that due to food wasted in processes involved post-harvest due to improper storage, lack of access to market, poor logistics leads to millions of people are left to starve, malnourished. Rich countries are the ones who waste food after its cooked and poor countries are struggling to protect the produced crops..</p>
                                   <p>This is a strong motivation to do something concrete to solve this global issue. I firmly believe it’s a duty of every global citizen to be sensitive towards these issues. My common cause would need cohesive united effort to address this problem.</p>

                                   <h2>Description</h2>
                                   <p>By building the application, I would like to achieve the following.</p>
                                   <p>1. Geographic mapping of crops which are cultivated in a province. This will enable the clear transparency of following data</p>
                                   <p>a. When is the harvest expected for sale?</p>
                                   <p>b. How much volume of crops is expected from each province?</p>
                                   <p>2. Buyers, Food processing companies can understand the supply and demand better</p>
                                   <p>3. Will help farmers to do crop planning based on scientific crop & soil management processes.</p>
                                   <p>4. Complete logistics, recyclable packaging and cold storage blocking to ensure optimal resource utilization.</p>
                                   <h4>Concept:</h4>
                                   <p>Farmer: Each farmer will have a smartphone through which he/she can input the details of the crops currently being farmed, expected yield and time of harvest.</p>
                                   <p>Buyers or food processors: will have the overall demand based on market demand and can input the amount of specific food crop and the price they are willing to pay for.</p>
                                   <p>Cold Storage or Food crop warehouses:  Based on these data the application will apply the aggregation and probability principles to find what is the project demand and how long will the storage facility be used for which type of crops.</p>
                                   <p>Process: My application would solve the problem of demand and supply not meeting within the stipulated shelf life of the produce. Incase of demand is lower than supply, we will clearly have an early indicator for the necessary steps to take in finding alternate markets are initiate food storage actions.</p>
                                   <p>Based on the shelf life of the products we can use the First In First Out method to distribute the food products. My application will enable unique identifiers for the date of production, shelf life details.</p>
                                   <p>To address the unplanned plantation of the same crops across a specific geography always results in overproduction of a particular food grain and under production of other food. This situation would be eliminated when farming is approached in a more systematic method.</p>
                                   <p>This tool will encompass an interaction platform where we can plan for auction of the product and will fetch faster access to markets across the nation without worry of logistics.</p>
                                   <p>Logistics experts will be part of the ecosystem and will be partnering with producers and buyers of the</p>
                                   <p>Another important feature of this application is live stock monitoring ( eg: Poultry, Dairy farm, Shrimp, Fish farms). Sensors employed in the livestock farms will feed in valuable data about the overall health of your produce.</p>
