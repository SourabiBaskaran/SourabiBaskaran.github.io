                                   <p>Food Loss and its impact on overall economy and human race. It is of paramount importance for world food program to work on this global issue. While we all are using Information technology for wider variety of problem solving, but food loss, which is one of root cause, is left less attended or ignored.</p>
                                   <p>I intend to contribute to this bigger agenda by building a small IT application, which will use information technological data obtained through careful study of food crops for many generations. I strongly believe that we can arrive at solution to eliminate food waste until it reaches the dining table.</p>

                                   <p>It is despicable thought that due to food wasted in processes involved post-harvest due to improper storage, lack of access to market, poor logistics leads to millions of people are left to starve, malnourished. Rich countries are the ones who waste food after its cooked and poor countries are struggling to protect the produced crops..</p>
                                   <p>This is a strong motivation to do something concrete to solve this global issue. I firmly believe itâ€™s a duty of every global citizen to be sensitive towards these issues. My common cause would need cohesive united effort to address this problem.</p>

                                   <h2>Description</h2>
                                   <p>By building the application, I would like to achieve the following.</p>
                                   <p>1. Geographic mapping of crops which are cultivated in a province. This will enable the clear transparency of following data</p>
                                   <p>a. When is the harvest expected for sale?</p>
                                   <p>b. How much volume of crops is expected from each province?</p>
                                   <p>2. Buyers, Food processing companies can understand the supply and demand better</p>
                                   <p>3. Will help farmers to do crop planning based on scientific crop & soil management processes.</p>
                                   <p>4. Complete logistics, recyclable packaging and cold storage blocking to ensure optimal resource utilization.</p>
                                   <h4>Concept:</h4>
                                   <p>Farmer: Each farmer will have a smartphone through which he/she can input the details of the crops currently being farmed, expected yield and time of harvest.</p>
                                   <p>Buyers or food processors: will have the overall demand based on market demand and can input the amount of specific food crop and the price they are willing to pay for.</p>
                                   <p>Cold Storage or Food crop warehouses:  Based on these data the application will apply the aggregation and probability principles to find what is the project demand and how long will the storage facility be used for which type of crops.</p>
                                   <p>Process: My application would solve the problem of demand and supply not meeting within the stipulated shelf life of the produce. Incase of demand is lower than supply, we will clearly have an early indicator for the necessary steps to take in finding alternate markets are initiate food storage actions.</p>
                                   <p>Based on the shelf life of the products we can use the First In First Out method to distribute the food products. My application will enable unique identifiers for the date of production, shelf life details.</p>
                                   <p>To address the unplanned plantation of the same crops across a specific geography always results in overproduction of a particular food grain and under production of other food. This situation would be eliminated when farming is approached in a more systematic method.</p>
                                   <p>This tool will encompass an interaction platform where we can plan for auction of the product and will fetch faster access to markets across the nation without worry of logistics.</p>
                                   <p>Logistics experts will be part of the ecosystem and will be partnering with producers and buyers of the</p>
                                   <p>Another important feature of this application is live stock monitoring ( eg: Poultry, Dairy farm, Shrimp, Fish farms). Sensors employed in the livestock farms will feed in valuable data about the overall health of your produce.</p>

                                   <h2>Artificial intelligence</h2>
                                   <h4>What does it do ?</h4>
                                   <p>Artificial intelligence is a simulation of human intelligence in machines that are normally programmed to think like humans. Does artificial intelligence look like a new technology? It originated in the year 1950 and it's now picking up its importance due to the advancement in the computing power of the hardware.  It is based on highly complex mathematical models combined with systematic problem-solving. artificial intelligence has a wide variety of applications starting from Medical Aerospace, Agriculture until and virtual office assistant.</p>
                                   <p>What are the examples of artificial intelligence are computer playing chess we might have heard of autonomous cars Humor examples in autonomous driving application of banking in particular when there is a fraudulent transaction in a credit card the artificial intelligence software recognizes this transaction based on various parameters like location of the car the spending pattern under regular point of sale so this help the bank.</p>
                                   <p>Autonomous driving Imports from the car sensor it has to take a decision whether to break or to divert and these decisions are highly dependent on the previous information what is store and the decision-making Matrix is used in their algorithm. </p>
                                   <p>In the case of my software artificial intelligence is used in smart decision-making to buy the software credit for the demand supply of food crops based on climatic and external factors in the world in the crop production.</p>
                                   <p>This will not only support application software but also the mobile application in which the farmers who are having lower literacy level talk and record the contents in a very smart way. This word I want to give a complex task of handling various mobile screens and process steps. based on this we can improve the user experience of the end-user.</p>
                                   <p>In all of the artificial intelligence applications, unlike the Hollywood films we would not be seeing flying cars robots failing cities machines to take control of human beings. it is purely a highly-capable application which can process huge amounts of data and has the capability to learn from its past experience it's a combination of neural network, deep learning, natural language processing, cognitive Computing and machine learning.</p>

                                   <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
                                   <p>Artificial intelligence impacts the world in a highly positive way especially in my project so as a backbone off the food management software.</p>
                                   <p>Based on the location of the software and that user details intelligently prompt the native crops map to the geographic location and games data access to the food types what is being eaten in the specific culture this intelligence will help the software to connect various producers and sellers off the food grains.</p>
                                   <p>In the case of a food grain the shelf life is highly important and artificial intelligence pass input from various answers located in the storage lighthouses; this sensor input is used to predict the burying shelf life based on the humidity temperature and other factors which affect the quality of the food grain. </p>
                              </div>

                                   <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
                                   <p>Whenever the word artificial intelligence has used and discussions they always receive a mix it reaction from people who are new to this password. They always have a fear about machine taking over Humanity. this is due to the misconception of artificial intelligence. next paragraph in case artificial intelligence collection of various things in your house this will enable A Better Living I will give you an example you are busy in your work day and when you are about to leave your office in case you have less amount of food material in your refrigerator your AI program will prompt you to drop in to the nearest grocery store and this information would be fed to your refrigerator. the moment you owe near your house the lighting the air-conditioning and all other parameters would be automatically set based on your preference.</p>
                                   <p>Coming back to our application this is going to have I totally different level of complexity and intelligence integrated into this. we Vulgate astonished in the way this program is going to communicate with different stakeholders and provide intelligent report to the application owner.  it is highly likely. Even the prices of the crops can be suggested based on the demand vs. Supply information also it can provide a forecast of shortage of food crops based on the cumulative data this can also serve as a highly reliable data for the government agencies who are responsible for managing agricultural products we would need experts in artificial intelligence to do the core program of our software based on inputs which will be analyzed using mathematical models and Arriva a binary decision of Sr know this binary decisions are summed up together to arrive at a meaning for information in form of human understandable graphics and charts or reports.</p>
