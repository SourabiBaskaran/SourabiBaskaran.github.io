                                        <p>I am passionate about avoiding food waste and lack of access to technology which leads to poor storage options 1/3rd of food produced is wasted per year = US$ 1Trillion. Food is a basic necessity and a human right as well. It's the responsibility of every person other than farmer to responsibly handle the food crops produced with a divine intention of relieving hunger of the whole universe. IT innovation that would lead to reducing wastes which are created by human error and lack of information at the right time by applying the science of information technology. My IT solution will help in understanding the food waste as a topic and will help in improving the same for a global perspective. As a team the competence of understanding the global problems and arriving at innovative solutions will be the skills which will be developed.</p>

                                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                                        <p>Food Loss and its impact on the overall economy and the human race. It is of paramount importance for the world food program to work on this global issue. While we all are using Information technology for a wider variety of problem-solving, food loss, which is one of the root causes, is left less attended or ignored.</p>
                                        <p>I intend to contribute to this bigger agenda by building a small IT application, which will use information technological data obtained through careful study of food crops for many generations. I strongly believe that we can arrive at the solution to eliminate food waste until it reaches the dining table.</p>

                                        <h2>Motivation</h2>
                                        <p>It is a despicable thought that due to food wasted in processes involved post-harvest due to improper storage, lack of access to market, poor logistics leads to millions of people being left to starve, malnourished. Rich countries are the ones who waste food after it’s cooked and poor countries are struggling to protect the produced crops.</p>
                                        <p>This is a strong motivation to do something concrete to solve this global issue. I firmly believe it’s the duty of every global citizen to be sensitive towards these issues. My common cause would need a cohesive united effort to address this problem (World Food Programme, 2020).</p>

                                        <h2>Description</h2>
                                        <p>By building the application, I would like to achieve the following.</p>
                                        <p>1. Geographic mapping of crops that are cultivated in a province. This will enable the clear transparency of following data.</p>
                                        <p>a. When is the harvest expected for sale?</p>
                                        <p>b. How much volume of crops is expected from each province?</p>
                                        <p>2. Buyers, Food processing companies can understand the supply and demand better.</p>
                                        <p>3. Will help farmers to do crop planning based on scientific crop & soil management processes.</p>
                                        <p>4. Complete logistics, recyclable packaging and cold storage blocking to ensure optimal resource utilization.</p>
                                        <h4>Concept:</h4>
                                        <p>Farmer: Each farmer will have a smartphone through which he/she can input the details of the crops currently being farmed, expected yield and time of harvest.</p>
                                        <p>Buyers or food processors: will have the overall demand based on market demand and can input the amount of specific food crop and the price they are willing to pay for.</p>
                                        <p>Cold Storage or Food crop warehouses:  Based on these data the application will apply the aggregation and probability principles to find what is the project demand and how long will the storage facility be used for which type of crops.</p>
                                        <p>Major Problems: Farmers don’t get the information of buyers and an element of uncertainty is haunting the farmer to settle for a poor price for the produce and thus the middle man earns the unethically higher margins. Farmers also lack knowledge of food processing, preserving technology which will save their hard work and offer an opportunity to sell a value added product.</p>
                                        <p>Process: My application would solve the problem of demand and supply not meeting within the stipulated shelf life of the produce. In case if the demand is lower than supply, we will clearly have an early indicator for the necessary steps to take in finding alternate markets to initiate food storage actions.</p>
                                        <p>Based on the shelf life of the products we can use the First In First Out (FIFO) method to distribute the food products. My application will enable unique identifiers for the date of production, shelf life details.</p>
                                        <p>To address the unplanned plantation of the same crops across specific geography always results in overproduction of particular food grain and under the production of other food. This situation would be eliminated when farming is approached in a more systematic method.</p>
                                        <p>This tool will comprise an interactive platform where we can plan for the auction of the product and will fetch faster access to markets across the nation without the worry of logistics.</p>
                                        <p>Logistics experts will be part of the ecosystem and will be partnering with producers and buyers of this supply chain.</p>
                                        <p>Another important feature of this application is livestock monitoring ( eg: Poultry, Dairy farm, Shrimp, Fish farms). Sensors employed in the livestock farms will feed valuable data about the overall health of your produce.</p>

                                        <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                                        <h4>What does it do ?</h4>
                                        <p>Artificial intelligence is a simulation of human intelligence in machines that are typically programmed to think like humans. Does artificial intelligence look like a new technology? It originated in the year of 1950 and it's now picking up its importance due to the advancement in the computing power of the hardware. </p>
                                        <p>It is based on highly complex mathematical models combined with systematic problem-solving. artificial intelligence has a wide variety of applications starting from Medical, Aerospace, Agriculture  and virtual office assistant.</p>
                                        <p>Few examples of artificial intelligence are, computer playing chess, autonomous cars, smart banking application and when there is a fraudulent transaction via a credit card, the artificial intelligence powered software recognizes this transaction based on various parameters like location of the car, the spending pattern under regular point of sale etc.</p>
                                        <p>Autonomous driving technology imports data from the car sensor, it has to make a decision whether to apply brakes or not during auto mode and these decisions are highly dependent on the previously stored information. For the successful implementation of this task, machine learning and the decision-making matrix are used.</p>
                                        <p>In the case of my software, artificial intelligence is used in smart forecasting, Making for the demand-supply of food crops based on climatic and external factors in cultivation.</p>
                                        <p>This will not only support PC softwares, but also the mobile applications in which the farmers who are having poor literacy rates, can talk and record the contents in a very smart way. Their speech will be processed through various algorithms and complex systems specifically designed for this allocated task ,and eventually it will be converted into text format with the help of AI engines. Furthermore utilizing machine learning techniques, these data will be fed into the system for long terms. Therefore we can improve the handy user experience to the end-user.</p>
                                        <p>In all of the artificial intelligence applications, unlike Hollywood movies, we would not be seeing robots taking control of cities, machines starting to rule the human race because it is purely a highly-capable application which can process huge amounts of data and has the capability to learn from its past experience since it's a combination of the neural network, deep learning, natural language processing, cognitive computing, and machine learning.</p>
                                        <p>Predicting the future state is one of the key strengths of AI. Deep learning is the basis of these unsupervised decision making and continual improvement of the decision making.</p>
                                        <p>As machine learning is used more often in products and services, there are some significant considerations when it comes to users’ trust in the Internet. Several issues must be considered when addressing AI, including, socio-economic impacts; issues of transparency, bias, and accountability; new uses for data, considerations of security and safety, ethical issues; and, how AI facilitates the creation of new ecosystems.At the same time, in this complex field, there are specific challenges faced by AI, which include: a lack of transparency and interpretability in decision-making; issues of data quality and potential bias; safety and security implications; considerations regarding accountability; and, its potentially disruptive impacts on social and economic structures.The collection of “Big Data” and the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), has made a perfect environment for new AI applications and services to grow. </p>
                                        <p>Applications based on AI are already visible in healthcare diagnostics, targeted treatment, transportation, public safety, service robots, education and entertainment, but will be applied in more fields in the coming years. Together with the Internet, AI changes the way we experience the world and has the potential to be a new engine for economic growth.</p>
                                        <p>Artificial intelligence is further defined as “narrow AI” or “general AI”. Narrow AI, which we interact with today, is designed to perform specific tasks within a domain (e.g. language translation). General AI is hypothetical and not domain specific, but can learn and perform tasks anywhere. This is outside the scope of this paper. This paper focuses on advances in narrow AI, particularly on the development of new algorithms and models in a field of computer science referred to as machine learning (Jake 2020).</p>

Before proceeding to our software case and its impact based on artificial intelligence we would look at some existing use cases where our day -to-day lives are impacted by artificial intelligence.In our daily work we see Google home and Alexa have digital virtual assistance these are developed based on the artificial intelligence software.</p>
                                        <p>Based on the location of the software and user details, our system can intelligently prompt the native crops map to the geographic location and gives data access of the food types that are being eaten in the specific culture. This intelligence will help the software to connect various producers and sellers of the food grains.In the case of food grain, the shelf life is highly important, and artificial intelligence passes inputs from various answers located in the storage lighthouses; this sensor input is used to predict the shelf life based on the humidity, temperature and other factors that affect the quality of the food grain. It’s highly unlikely for a normal human being to track all the parameters manually and protect the food groups.</p>
                                        <p>Currently what is visibly seen in existence is use of AI in the grocery store for projecting and marketing the right products for its customers and doing so reduces the wastage of food crops at the distribution center level. This also avoids overstocking and its associated regulatory requirements and storage requirements.Artificial software also predicts the diseases which will affect specific crops and plants and offers advance notifications to the agricultural department based on high complex mathematical calculations and data.The impact on the profession, and its ability to respond, depends on two factors: percentage of work susceptible to automation and speed of change. </p>

                                        <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
                                        <p>Whenever the word artificial intelligence has been thrown among the general public,the angle of their perception is completely different toward this word and they conceive it is not for them and some kind of rocket science. They are always suspicious about machines taking over Humanity. This is due to the misconceptions of artificial intelligence fed by Hollywood movies and other fictions. Installation of AI powered devices in your house will enable you a  “well sophisticated living experience”. For instance, imagine you are busy with your work and when you are about to leave your office, in case you have less amount of food storage in your refrigerator. Then your AI program will give you an alert to purchase needed commodities and groceries and also the same information will be sent to your pre-set grocery store . Then they will start to take actions according to your prescription you already given to the store. So you can easily get the things you need without any delay while you are on the way to your house because it will already be packed and set by your grocery store.</p>
                                        <p>Coming back to our application, this system requires the next level of complexity and intelligence integrated into this. We are going to be surprised at the way this program is going to communicate with different stakeholders and provide accurate reports to the application owner accordingly. Even the prices of the crops can be suggested based on the demand vs. Supply information we have already fed into the system. It can provide a forecast of shortage and excessive yield of food crops based on the cumulative data. This can also serve as a highly reliable data source for the government agencies who are responsible for managing agricultural products. We would need experts in artificial intelligence and machine learning  to do the core program of our software based on inputs which will be analyzed using mathematical models and  binary decisions. As we know this binary decisions are summed up together to arrive at a meaning for information in form of human-understandable graphics and charts or reports.</p>

                                        <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
                                        <h4>What does it do ?</h4>
                                        <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. This system helps us to access technology services such as computing power, storage, and databases on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider instead of buying, owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers. This service is widely used by industries and organizations for various purposes such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development, and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. For example, health care companies are using cloud services to develop and deliver more personalized treatment for patients. Real-time fraud detection and prevention is possibly done by financial firms via cloud computing. In addition to that, it helps companies to reduce the expenses in up-front IT infrastructure costs and it is supporting the applications of the companies to make it much more efficient and faster with the enhanced performance and less maintenance (Dats flair, 2020).</p>
                                        
                                        <div class="tab-pane-item">

                                        </div>
                                        
                                        <p>Fig.4. Guru 2020, ‘Advantages and Disadvantages Of Cloud Computing’,System modernization of cloud computing, viewed on 16 December 2020, (https://www.guru99.com/advantages-disadvantages-cloud-computing.html).</p>
                                        <p>In our case, we are dealing with a huge amount of data from our customers. Some questions need to be answered when a new customer signs in to our services. He can answer it verbally(as we mentioned earlier most of the farmers lack a literacy rate so with the help of AI it will be implemented), or he may type it and submit his request to join our service. These data should be stored in a safe place and this type of data will be considered permanent data. The other type of data we are using is temporary which can be generated while the trade occurs through our application. For example, one of the farmers might update details about his cultivation and harvesting. In the meantime, one of our wholesale or retail buyers might input about their needs. So in order to analyze and match these data accordingly, firstly it should be stored in a place and then our system will be processing data one by one with the help of AI algorithms. Then It will help the buyer to find a vendor who can fulfill his needs.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, as we are going to deal with the locations of the croplands to define the correct place, we need to work with the longitudes and latitudes of the earth. This is how our whole system is supposed to run. So the geographic locations also to be permanently saved in our cloud storage. It helps the buyer to find a place that is very close to him but this would be possible only if both the producers and buyers prefer to update their location data.</p>
                                        <p>Cloud computing can be divided into two categories.</p>
                                        <p>1. Deployment model</p>
                                        <p>2. Service model</p>
                                        <p>Deployment model, It has been categorized into 3 subdivisions</p>
                                        <p>1. Public cloud</p>
                                        <p>2. Private cloud</p>
                                        <p>3. Hybrid cloud</p>
                                        <p>In our case, we are going to use the hybrid cloud model because the private cloud model is needed to store customer’s personal information and the public cloud is going to be used for the other information regarding the crops yield and locations. The major advantage of using the public cloud is, it is cost-effective and easily accessible. On the other hand, we need a private cloud due to the security reasons for the data.</p>
                                        <p>While we dig into the topic further, we need to choose which service model should be implemented to make ease of our work. There are 3 different types of services available based on the customer’s need. They are</p>
                                        <p>1. IaaS: It provides basic computing infrastructure. Services are available on Pay-for-what-you-use-model. Service providers are Amazon web services, Microsoft Azure, and Google computer engine and the users are IT administrators.</p>
                                        <p>2. PaaS: It provides both the cloud platform and runtime environment for developing, testing, and maintaining applications. The collaborative partners are software developers.</p>
                                        <p>3. Saas: Everything will be managed by the vendor/ service provider. We do not need to maintain anything on our own. All the required supports will be provided by the host but this is not a cost-effective solution.</p>
                                        <p>3. As we are planning to work with techies and software developers we will go with PaaS. We expect to utilize our workers in order to create our own platform. It will surely help us to keep control of all our customer’s sensitive information.
                                             The below-given chart clearly shows the differences between all four types of services and the final decision will be made out analyzing these pros and cons of the service.</p>

                                        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
                                        <p>The Cloud computing market has been growing rapidly and now more than 62% of CRM software are cloud-based. The growth rate has reached 22.8% and will exceed $127.5Due to the arrival of cloud storage, on-premise infrastructures are slowly moving to the brink of extinction phase because most of the organizations already started to switch to cloud computing from using physical data servers. Most of the time, small companies and startups are facing a lot of serious issues in using physical data centers. They are very expensive and less scalable, not like virtual data centers, they require a considerable amount of space to install the whole infrastructure, furthermore, it is essential to appoint a team to manage hardware and software maintenance but in cloud computing, most of the services will be given by the service providers like AZURE, AWS, or another one. Even Though their service might vary from one to another, most of the features resemble each other.</p>
                                        <p>The next most important part of handling data is security. Nowadays, it is being a cakewalk for hackers to do phishing, trojan injection, and other kinds of hacking. Here it requires a staunch firewall and vulnerability testing systems. Comparatively using cloud systems is safer than using physical data storage devices or servers because investors have invested a bajillion dollars in cloud computing systems. In our case, data security and privacy are very important. We should be loyal and trustworthy to our customers in keeping their private data safe. Then only we can retain them into our ecosystem. Furthermore, as our initial investment is going to be a very small amount, we will be limited in all types of resources. So, the best way is to move to cloud storage systems. It can be fast, efficient and persons from all over the world can collaborate and access the data over the internet.</p>
                                   
                                   </div>
 
                                   <div class="tab-pane-item">
                                        <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
                                        <p>The success of the project is determined by the number of users and the annual profit we gain. On this basis, we can see that moving to cloud computing technology will help us to give fast and smoother service to our clients, and also we can provide our services for less cost. It would be more convenient for our farmers and other small business proprietors because this technology doesn’t need any kind of hardware installments and since purchasing and maintaining the equipment are done by service providers we can save a massive amount of money. Then It directly leads us to give our service to everyone at affordable rates.</p>
                                        <p>The next prominent role of cloud computing is, it will have all the details of the amount of crop yield for a given time period (annually or monthly), demand for a specific product, details about the margin between production and consumption (whether it is a shortage or redundant), negotiations, buying and selling prices etc. Farmers can access all these data within a few seconds and come to a conclusion like this time which crop should be cultivated, what are the most selling products, how the buying rates are fluctuating during the specific time interval etc. So it will give them a clear picture of current market conditions and they can act accordingly. It will save them from disastrous losses and bankruptcies. For all these reasons, cloud seeding and cloud computing is inevitable in the industry.</p>
                                        <p>Nowadays most people are using smartphones so installing this app and using it is not going to be that hard even if it hard for some group of people we can arrange workshops to make them accustomed to the environment of the applications and they will definitely feel the difference between our service and our competitor’s service and we hope cloud computing will take us to reach the next milestone of our goal.</p>
